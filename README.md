# Tictactoe
It is a simple tic-tac-toe game made using java programming language . Here the programme randomly chooses the player's turn and determines what character you represent.
The logic is similar to the game played in a piece of paper and it has the win,lose or tie results implemented onto a textfield created above that shows the results.
This is a personal project made for improving skills on java.
